        <h2>What does a full stack developer do?</h2>

        A Full Stack Developer is a relatively new role which brings together the skills and roles for what were
        traditionally known as web designer and web developer. Web designer worked on the design of the site, and the
        web
        developer worked on the code. As the web has grown more and more complex, and customers are seeking more complex
        solutions for their on-line presence, the two roles have become more specialised and technical. Further in some
        cases, the two roles and skills have become inter-linked, resulting in the position of Full Stack Developer.
        <br>
        The different categories are: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                front end development (the visible parts of a website or application)
            </li>
            <li>
                back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)
            </li>
            <li>
                full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a
                native
                application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        A full stack developer is a web developer or engineer who works with both the front and back ends of a website
        or
        application. In this sense, they provide an end-to-end service, and can be involved in projects that involve
        databases and building user-facing websites. Their role can extend to working with clients during the planning
        phase
        of projects.
        <br>As the line between the front end versus back end increasingly blurs, more developers are becoming “full
        stack.”
        A lot of employers (especially agencies who work on different kinds of sites) are looking for developers who
        know
        how to work on all the parts of a site, so they can use the best tools for the job regardless of whether it’s
        technically “front end” or “back end.”
        <br>
        For large or specialised projects, often the Full Stack Developer may involve others to write specialised code -
        although importantly, the Full Stack Developer must be familiar with and highly skilled in most aspects of web
        and
        application development.
        <br>
        Full Stack Developer responsibilities <br>
        The primary responsibility of a Full Stack Developer includes designing user interactions on websites,
        developing
        servers and databases for website functionality and coding for mobile platforms.
        <br>
        <h3>Particular responsibilities often include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
